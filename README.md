# Prework - *Aurafy*

Submitted by: **Erick Rivadeneira**

**Aurafy** is an app that... uses AI to analyze mood or "aura" through photo uploads, mood-to-color mapping, and music streaming integration to create personalized playlists, track mood trends over time, and generate shareable weekly summaries.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
3 Apps:
- Spotify: Yearly Spotify Wrapped Feature and specialized playlists that are generated/ AI DJ. 
- Apple Music: The sleekness of the lyrics screen of the song when you put it up.
- Pinterest: I kind of like the set-up where it is just a grid of pictures that you swipe through that you can save to personalize your timeline.

App Idea: 

An iOS app that generates personalized playlists based on the userâ€™s mood or "aura," represented visually through colors. It integrates AI for mood/aura detection, music streaming connectivity, and mood tracking over time.

1. Mood Input Options
Photo Upload: Users upload a photo (facial or non-facial) that the app analyzes for mood or "aura." The app interprets environmental colors, objects, or facial expressions to detect vibes.
Feedback During Processing: While the playlist loads, the app provides feedback on what it detects (e.g., "calming greens and blues suggest relaxation").
Adjust Mood/Aura: Users can tweak the detected mood or aura to align with their desired vibe before finalizing the playlist.
2. Music Connectivity
Apple Music and Spotify Integration: Allows users to connect their accounts, enabling seamless playlist creation and playback.
3. Mood Representation with Colors
A standard mood-to-color mapping system visually represents each detected mood or aura, making the experience immersive and aesthetic.
4. Mood Tracking Over Time
Tracks user moods or auras based on their interactions and inputs.
Generates a weekly "wrapped" summary that includes:
Overview of moods/aura trends throughout the week.
A personalized quote or insight.
Sharing options for social media to showcase their summary and playlists.
5. AI Integration
Uses machine learning to analyze photos, text (if added later), and other inputs to detect mood or aura.
Tailors playlists to match the detected mood with precision.
6. Customization & Personalization
Users can refine playlists or mood/aura detection as needed.
The app learns preferences over time to improve suggestions.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I think my computer is old, as I have a 2020 Macbook with an Intel processor, the load time for the simulation took over an hour to do.
